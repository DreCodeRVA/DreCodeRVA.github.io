            Bio
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a junior at CodeRVA regional highschool. I am from Sussex County which is an hour south from Richmond. Some of my favorite things to do consist of playing sports, playing video games, learning new things, and doing my best. I have played American football since 6th grade, and I just started playing basketball this year. The type of video games I play mainly consist of sports and action games.

        <h2>
            Description
        </h2>
        <p>
            After asking people to describe me the 3 words I heard often were calm, funny, and unique. I like to think I am a positive thinking person. The reasoning behind my positive attitude is I know what it is like to deal with bad attitudes, so I try my hardest to prevent that feeling on someone else. I also like to think i am a hardworking individual. I will be the first one in and the last one out to perfect any task given to me.

        <p>
            As stated earlier I am a CodeRVA Junior this participates in the Associate Degree Pathway. I have taken a variety of classes (His 121, Eng 111, CSC 101, and more). This pathway is a lot more strict but I do everyting I can to express myself and learn everything I can. After graduating I plan on going to college for Computer Engineering at Old Dominion University, Virginia Tech, or Virginia State University.       </p>
