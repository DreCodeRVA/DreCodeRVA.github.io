                This is one of the first moments I felt a connection to the sport I played. It gave me a sense of pride, teamwork, accountability, and respect. It unlocked a part of me I did not know I had hidden inside.

                    I have been doing this since 9th grade. It introduced me to computer engineering and electrical work. Providing experiences that will help me in the near and far future. The environment broght by the FRC and FTC competitions thrills me and brings a rush of adrenaline that is very pleasing.

                   Now I do not want to sound like Michael Jordan, but in 8th grade I got cut and refused to ever tryout again until my junior year. The reason for change is my rapid growth spurt. Then I made the team, enjoying every single moment of it.

                I worked with a man from my church that allowed me to work on diesel boat engines with him. I really got a look at a career choice I would not have expected to be so interesting.

                My first ever summer job where i got $20 for every yard I helped cut. I would work with my grandfather and father and cut yards in the area. This showed me the realism of working and built my work ethic.
